## Using Your Word Clock

### Adjusting Brightness

Lay the clock face up (lying on its back). After 5 seconds, the brightness resets to maximum. The clock will then dim slightly every few seconds. Stand the Clock Upright when the desired brightness is reached.

### Setting Off Hours (turn off the display at certain times)

1. Set off hours: Lay the clock face down, i.e., letters touching the table. Leave it face-down for the duration you want the display to be off daily. For example, turn it off between 10 pm and 6 am by laying it face down at 10 pm and moving it back upright at 6 am. Stand the clock upright when done.
2. Clear Off Hours: To remove off hours, lay the clock face down for between 5 seconds and 5 minutes and then stand it upright.

### Adjusting Time Zone

If the displayed time is incorrect due to time zone settings, adjust it as follows:

1. Decrease the time zone by one hour: Lay the Clock on its left side. Every 5 seconds, the time zone decreases by one hour. Stand the clock upright when the correct time is displayed.
2. Increase the time zone by One Hour: Lay the Clock on its right side. Every 5 seconds, the time zone increases by one hour. Stand the clock upright when the correct time is displayed.
3. Reset to automatic time zone: Lay the clock face up for over one minute. The clock will revert to automatic time zone detection.

Note: Manually setting the time zone disables automatic Daylight Saving Time adjustments.

### Resetting Wi-Fi Configuration

To reset the Wi-Fi configuration, turn the clock upside down. After 5 seconds, Wi-Fi settings will reset. The clock will display “WI FI” in red. Reconfigure Wi-Fi as per "Connecting to Wi-Fi".

## Troubleshooting
